\title{Example simulation from Brown and Forsythe (1974)}
\description{
Example results from the Brown and Forsythe (1974) article on robust estimators for
variance ratio tests. Statistical tests are organized by columns and the unique design conditions
are organized by rows. See \code{\link{BF_sim_alternative}} for an alternative form of the same
simulation. Code for this simulation is available of the wiki
(\url{https://github.com/philchalmers/SimDesign/wiki}).
