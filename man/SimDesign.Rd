\title{Structure for Organizing Monte Carlo Simulation Designs}
\description{
Structure for Organizing Monte Carlo Simulation Designs
}
\details{
Provides tools to help organize Monte Carlo simulations in R.
The tools provided control the structure and back-end of the Monte Carlo simulations
by utilizing a generate-analyse-summarise strategy. The functions
control common simulation issues such as re-simulating non-convergent results,
support parallel back-end computations, save and restore temporary files,
aggregate results across independent nodes, and provide native support for debugging..
The primary function for
organizing the simulations is \code{\link{runSimulation}}.
