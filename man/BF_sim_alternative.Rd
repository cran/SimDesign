\title{(Alternative) Example simulation from Brown and Forsythe (1974)}
\description{
Example results from the Brown and Forsythe (1974) article on robust estimators for
variance ratio tests. Statistical tests and distributions are organized by columns
and the unique design conditoins are organized by rows. See \code{\link{BF_sim}} for an alternative
form of the same simulation where distributions are also included in the rows.
Code for this simulation is available on the wiki (\url{https://github.com/philchalmers/SimDesign/wiki}).
