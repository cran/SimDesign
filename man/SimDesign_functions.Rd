\title{Skeleton functions for simulations}
\usage{
SimDesign_functions(filename = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{a character vector indicating whether the output should be saved to two respective files
containing the simulation design and the functional components, respectively. Using this option
is generally the recommended approach when designing simulations}
}
\description{
This function prints skeleton versions of the required functions and work-flow required
to run simulations, complete with the correct inputs and class of outputs. Use this at the start
when defining your simulation.

\examples{

SimDesign_functions()

\dontrun{

# write output files
SimDesign_functions('mysim')
}
